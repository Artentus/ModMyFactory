New versions can be added from existing local installations or downloaded directly from the factorio.com website (requires login). The Steam version is also fully supported.  
Each version can be custom named and updated individually so you can keep track of which version you use for which modpack.

Loading directly into a specific savegame and custom arguments are also supported.

ModMyFactory allows sharing of arbitrarily complex modpacks with ease. You can export the modpacks you create and others can import them with a few clicks.  
Exported modpacks support a plethora of settings on a per-mod basis, as well as the ability to directly include mod files so mods don't have to be downloaded on import.

If you are missing dependencies for some of your mods ModMyFactory will tell you in an obvious but unintrusive manner.
